This project focuses on analyzing weather data to identify patterns, trends, and insights using Python and its data analysis libraries. The main objective is to perform data cleaning, visualization, and exploratory data analysis to better understand temperature, humidity, wind, and other weather-related factors.

The main objective of this project is to analyze weather conditions using Python programming and its libraries. By applying different data analysis techniques, the project aims to:

• Practice data cleaning and basic feature engineering. 
• Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and create clear visualizations. 
• Derive insights and communicate results in a short presentation. 
• (Optional) Build a simple predictive model.

Required tools 
• Python 3.8+ and Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab 
• Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn.
